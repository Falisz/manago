Following roadmap and tasks to-do as of 2025-09-14:
### Frontend
- [ ] General app behaviour
  - [ ] Right-Click custom menu.
  - [ ] Implement role and permission based restrictions over the UI.

   - [ ] Team assignment form - for bulk team users assignments.
   - [ ] Add a subteam option in the Team details to create a new team with preset parent_team.
- [ ] Branches

  - [ ] Teams nor Users cannot be assigned to Teams across different branches. Same with a Manager reporting system.
