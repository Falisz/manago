Following roadmap and tasks to-do as of 2025-09-14:

- [ ] General app behaviour

- [ ] Users and teams management
  - [ ] Selection feature in the user lists with actions like bulk delete, assign Role and assign Manager
  - [ ] Team assignment form - for bulk team users assignments.
- [ ] Branches

  - [ ] Teams nor Users cannot be assigned to Teams across different branches. Same with a Manager reporting system.
