## DESIGN NOTES:
- Two subpages in Work Planner:
  - a Schedule page with currently published schedule
    - a Workings Schedules with all WIP schedules authored or available by a given Manager.
- Edit button in the Schedule page creates a copy of the given schedule scope in the frontend and allows a user to edit it - It's only in the frontend and can be either:
  - Published - instantly sends new revision of the shifts to the server replacing the old ones - for given days;
  - Saved - meaning it is saved as a Working Schedule to be later on access from the backend.
- On the Working Schedules there is an option to create a new empty schedule for a given scope of dates and people or edit any existing ones,
- Editing the Published Schedule can be either saved (to a Working Schedule), discarded or published. (Publishing the Working Schedule to replace edited dates.)
- Working Schedule has a set date range, but this can be altered. If shrinking it and reducing dates that already have shifts planned, those shifts will be removed once Schedule is saved.
- Each Working Schedule can be further saved, deleted or published.
- Publishing essentially means the Working Schedules to be deleted and shift in it being 'freed' from Schedule ID to be treated as published - viewable to respectively targeted users.
- In case of conflict in publishing working schedule because there already are some shifts for the specific day published, there are two options:
  - replace - grabs IDs of already existing shifts from conflicting days in scope, and they get removed. Then the shifts get posted.
  - skip - skips the days that currently have existing shifts.
- Performance limits in place - no larger scope than 31 days and 100 users.
- It will also require a new component - Leave Planner - that will be aside an option from Shift schedules and Dispositions just for scheduling eventual Leaves.
- Each Shift can also be opened in a detailed mode - and edited or deleted like any other resource. The shift can be reassigned to another person, moved to a different day or time. It can be also individually published or reverted to the working schedule (if there is any authored).
